When I was a teenager and lived in my Dorf in Brazil, I'd watch the sunset every day.

I was living exclusively in the city for about 4 or 5 years at that time, and having grown up in a farm and being in constant touch with nature until I was 9 shaped me into being a nature's lover.

At the time I felt a terrible urge to go back to nature. I was a self-entitled anarchoprimitivist and thought most technology was bad and that the human kind did wrong when moved itself away from God's beautiful creations (I was some kind of religious kid back then). This terrible urge led me to skip classes one day to go to a very dangerous forest in the city's outskirts with my best friend. It was a cool adventure until we got robbed our sweet mp3 players by a crazy crack head with a knife - life.

I'd spend hours writing endless rants about the meaning of life, physics and philosophy in my old-school notebooks while contemplating sunset. Lots of the time these three things would merge together and I'd get myself wondering: what the fuck.

Today I went watching the sunset by myself in a nearby beach. It's an interesting exercise.

There are a few people watching the sunset. I suspect some of them are there everyday, but I try to give people their privacy, so I'm not really sure.

It's an interesting exercise because it's a moment where even though I have my phone and the whole world's knowledge, and all of my friendships, and lots of my desires, expectations, fears, loves, inside this little black magic box, I don't really feel the urge that consumes me while I have it with me at other more common times of the day to look at it. I sit there, and I look at the clouds and the beautiful colors the sun is throwing in there with the magic of optics and our atmosphere and I just feel gratitude for living in a world filled with beauty.

It's also an interesting exercise because all of the times I have gone there up until now, I'm the only female looking person that's alone and I'm one of the few persons who are alone. I wonder why aren't more females alone in the beach to watch the sunset? In Brazil my obvious answer would be: because it's dangerous of course - but in Europe, I really wonder. Are women less lonely? They're usually more often surrounded by friends and family? Anyways, I like to be alone watching the sunset because it makes me feel alone. I don't feel like I spend enough time with myself but being there makes me feel like I can finally breath and think.

I watch sunsets today but I don't wonder anymore about the meaning of life, physics or philosophy. It's funny to me, how it seems like I became a much more enclosed egocentric person looking so much at the inside and trying to figure my shit out. I think that's growing up - because adults, the "adults", they have such complicated lives.

I hope it's not a reflex of me thinking I'm so special, a reflex of me moving to a place that have so few problems around me in the real world that allows me to look exclusively at the inside and see only my problems. I hope it's because life is complicated now, more than it used to be, and it's hard to figure out everybody else shit when you don't have your own figured out. Maybe the answers I found for these elementary questions are now good enough to ease my soul, and I can focus on improving myself and looking at the inside.

Though, I can't wait to have the peace of mind to worry about the meaning of life, physics and philosophy again.
